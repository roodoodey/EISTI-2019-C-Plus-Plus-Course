 In this program we will look at input and multiway if, else if,

 based on the input value. We will then use the grade to print out different

 *********** ENUMERATORS ***********

/**
 An enum is a type which holds values of type int
 in a human readable manner. In this case A=0, B=1
 etc. We can initialize A=10, and then B=11. If we
 initialize A=10, B=1, then C=2 automatically if
 we do not provide a value.

/*
 Function declaration so the compiler knows this function exists.
 This function takes the first parameter points which indicates the points
 the user scored on the exam. The total points is the number of points available
 in total in the exam. Based on this we will return a Grade enumeration object
 on the scale of A-F.

 Calculates the percentatge score based on the points of the student scored divided
 by the total points on the exam, multiplied by a hundred to give us a percentage but

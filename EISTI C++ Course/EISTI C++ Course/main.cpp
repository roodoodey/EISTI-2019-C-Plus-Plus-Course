 In this program we will look at input and multiway if, else if,

 based on the input value. We will then use the grade to print out different
 information about the student with a switch statement.

 Function declaration so the compiler knows this function exists.
 This function takes the first parameter points which indicates the points
 the user scored on the exam. The total points is the number of points available
 in total in the exam. Based on this we will return a grade on the scale of A-F
 as a char (ASCII characters).

 Calculates the percentatge score based on the points of the student scored divided
